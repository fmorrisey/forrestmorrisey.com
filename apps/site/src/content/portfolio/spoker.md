## Solo Capstone Project

An E-Commerce MERN STACK Application built in less than three weeks. With little prior experience in this stack I created a web application that empowers bike shop owners to have an online presence without having to hire a development team to custom build a site for their store.

## Features

- Inventory control
- Email confirmation
- Mobile responsive design
- Sales analytics
- User authentication
- Orders management

## Tech Stack

MERN Stack (noSQL / MongoDB / Mongoose / Express JS / React/Redux / JWT / Bootstrap / NodeMailer)
