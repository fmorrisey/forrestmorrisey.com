## Portraits

Portrait photography is about more than capturing a likeness. It's about revealing something of who a person is — their character, their story, their presence.

This collection spans studio work, environmental portraits, and candid moments. Each image is a collaboration between photographer and subject, a shared creation of something meaningful.

## The Approach

I believe the best portraits come from genuine connection. When a subject feels seen and valued, that comes through in the image. Technical skill matters, but human connection matters more.

These photographs represent that philosophy — images where the person behind the camera and the person in front of it found a moment of authentic connection.

*Every journey begins with a choice.*
