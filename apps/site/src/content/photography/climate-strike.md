## Milwaukee Climate Strike!

On September 20th, 2019, Milwaukee joined cities around the world in a global climate strike. Thousands took to the streets to demand action on climate change.

These images document the energy, passion, and hope of the day. Young and old alike gathered to make their voices heard on one of the defining issues of our time.

The climate strike was a powerful reminder that change begins with people coming together, with voices raised, with a collective refusal to accept the status quo.

## The Day

The atmosphere was electric. Signs painted with urgent messages, chants echoing through downtown streets, a community united by concern for our planet's future.

Photography has the power to document moments that matter. These images are a small record of a day when Milwaukee stood up for the Earth.

*Every journey begins with a choice.*
