## The Vision

Every developer eventually wants to own their digital presence completely. No Squarespace. No Wix. No templates. Just pure, intentional design backed by infrastructure you control.

## The Stack

I chose Astro for its simplicity and performance, Docker for containerization, and Caddy as a reverse proxy. The result is a fast, secure, and maintainable platform.

## Lessons Learned

Building your own platform teaches you things no tutorial can. You learn to make tradeoffs, to prioritize, and to ship something imperfect rather than nothing perfect.

## What's Next

This platform will continue to evolve. New features, better performance, and more content are all on the horizon.
