## Hello World

Every programmer knows the significance of these two words. It's the first thing we learn to output, the first proof that our code is working, the first small victory in a journey of thousands.

This post marks not just the beginning of a blog, but the beginning of a new chapter. A chapter where I've chosen to embrace technology and design as more than just interests — as a career, a passion, a way of engaging with the world.

## The Journey Ahead

There's something powerful about putting thoughts into writing. It forces clarity. It creates accountability. It leaves a trail of breadcrumbs to look back on.

Here, I'll document the journey — the projects, the lessons, the victories and the stumbles. Code snippets and design decisions. Technical deep-dives and philosophical musings.
