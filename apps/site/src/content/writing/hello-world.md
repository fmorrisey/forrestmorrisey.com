Over a decade ago I went to school for Video Game Design and Software Engineering. However, life had other plans and years later I found myself teaching in the Milwaukee Community. While do so, I rediscovered my long-lost love of computer programming and graphic design.

With that, I am happy to announce that I have enrolled in [devCodeCamp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devcodecamp/) to become a Full-Stack Developer! Going back to Tech Industry and giving myself another shot at my dreams that I gave up on over a decade ago.

Thank you to everyone that I have worked with and that have helped me along the way, I would not have been able to to this without you.
