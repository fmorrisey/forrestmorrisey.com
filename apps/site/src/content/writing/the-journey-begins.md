## The Journey Begins

Every journey begins with a choice.

Some choices are small — what to eat, where to walk, how to spend an afternoon. Others reshape everything. This post is about one of those larger choices.

## Transition

The path from where I was to where I'm going wasn't a straight line. It rarely is. Sometimes you have to wander to find your direction.

I discovered that the things I was doing for fun — building small projects, tinkering with code, designing interfaces — were what I wanted to do all the time. The realization that I could turn these interests into a career changed everything.

## Why Tech and Design

There's something uniquely satisfying about creation in the digital space. You start with nothing — an empty file, a blank canvas — and you build something that can be shared, used, improved, iterated upon.

Technology is the medium. Design is the intention. Together, they create experiences.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. There's so much to learn, so much to build, so many stories to tell.

Join me on this journey.

*Every journey begins with a choice.*
