## The Journey Begins

Mt. Rainier has always been on my list. Standing at 14,411 feet, it's the most prominent peak in the Cascades and a true test of mountaineering skills.

## Training Plan

Months of preparation go into a climb like this. Cardio, strength training, and technical skills all need to come together.

## What's Next

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through my training and eventually make the attempt.
